# The Benefits of Understanding Microsoft Purview Roles and Permissions Through a Flowchart

The Microsoft Purview documentation on roles and permissions provides an in-depth understanding of the platform's governance framework. The blog on Microsoftâ€™s official site ([Data Governance Roles and Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/data-governance-roles-permissions)) is a great resource, offering detailed explanations and use cases to help readers grasp the technicalities. However, for many users, sifting through textual content to piece together the relationships between roles and permissions can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

This is where a flowchart proves invaluable. By translating the information into a visual representation, the roles and permissions structure becomes easier to follow and comprehend at a glance.
